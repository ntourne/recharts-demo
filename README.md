# React + Recharts

This is a simple project to test [Recharts](https://recharts.org/en-US/) (a composable charting library built on React components).
Also, I used [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) with TypeScript to create a simple React application.

You can check out [demo site](https://ntourne.github.io/recharts-demo/).

## Getting Started

1/ Clone repository.

2/ Install dependencies.

```
npm install
```

3/ Start project in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

```
npm start
```

4/ Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

```
npm run build
```
